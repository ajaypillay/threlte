Threlte 6 provides a much more mature and feature-rich APi and developer experience than
its predecessor at the cost of a lot of breaking changes. This guide will help you migrate
your Threlte 5 project to Threlte v6.

<Tip type="danger">
  This document is a work in progress and will be updated up until the point of the first release of
  Threlte 6. There are probably more breaking changes than listed here. Your Editor will help you
  migrating with autocompletions and type checking.
</Tip>

## Preprocessing

Preprocessing is not needed anymore starting from Threlte 6. This means you
may remove the preprocessor `@threlte/preprocess` from your project as well as its
configuration in `svelte.config.js`. You can now use the [component `<T>`](/docs/reference/core/t) directly.

## `<Three>` is now `<T>`

Threlte 6 merges the `<Three>` and `<T>` components into a single component. The property `type` was renamed to `is`
to also properly reflect the fact that it can be used with already instantiated objects.

## `@threlte/core` is only about the `<T>` component

The `@threlte/core` package is now only about the `<T>` component. It does not provide any abstractions
that have been part of the core package before. _Some_ of these abstractions (`<TransformControls>`,
`<OrbitControls>`, audio components and several hooks) have been moved to `@threlte/extras` as this is the new
home for commonly used abstractions.

## Prop types

Threlte 6 heavily relies on prop types that Three.js naturally understands. As such, the prop types you may have
previously used to define for example the position of an object changed. Threlte v5 provided its own prop types
`Position` (e.g. `{ x, y, z }`), `Rotation` and others which are now removed or deprecated. While not yet all
abstractions fully make use of the new prop types, we're working on it. Your editor should be able to provide
you with the correct prop types for the components you're using.

## Interactivity

Interactivity is now handled by a plugin that's available at `@threlte/extras`. It's much more mature and flexible
in terms of event handling. For instance – as some of you requested – you may now define on what object the main
event listener is placed. Check out [its documentation](/docs/reference/extras/interactivity) to learn more.

## `useLoader` now returns a store

The hook [`useLoader`](/docs/reference/core/hooks#useloader) now returns a custom Svelte store called
[`AsyncWritable`](/docs/reference/core/utilities#asyncwritable). This store allows you to [await](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/await-blocks)
the loading of the resource while also implementing a regular Svelte store. It also now caches the results
of the loader function so that it's not called multiple times for the same resource. You will most likely
benefit from quite a performance boost in applications that rely heavily on external resources.

## `useThrelteRoot` has been removed

The hook `useThrelteRoot` has been removed and its properties have partially been merged into `useThrelte` as well as
a new internal context which is not exposed. All other contexts (which were used internally) have also been merged or removed.

## `<Pass>` and the default effects rendering are removed

In the effort of clear separation of concerns, the component `<Pass>` as well as the rendering with Three.js default
`EffectComposer` have been removed. Threlte 6 now provides a hook called [`useRender`](/docs/reference/core/hooks#userender) which
allows you to easily set up sophisticated rendering pipelines. As soon as a `useRender` hook is implemented, Threlte's
default render pipeline is disabled. `useRender` callbacks will be invoked _after_ all callback to `useFrame` have been
invoked. This means that you can use `useFrame` to update your objects and `useRender` to render it. `useRender` also has the option of
ordering callbacks to orchestrate the rendering pipeline across multiple components.

## Threlte's main context types

Thelte's main context contains Svelte stores. These stores are now a custom Threlte store called
[`CurrentWritable`](/docs/reference/core/utilities#currentwritable) which is a store that contains a `current` value with
a reference to the current value of the store. This means it does not need to be unwrapped manually (and expensively!) in
non-reactive places such as loops. For instance, let's have a look at its usage in the hook
[`useFrame`](/docs/reference/core/hooks#useframe) where the context is available as the first argument
to the callback:

```ts
useFrame(({ camera, colorSpace }) => {
  // instead of get(camera) we now can …
  camera.current // THREE.Camera
  colorSpace.current // THREE.ColorSpace
})
```

The full type definition is [currently listed here](/docs/reference/core/hooks#usethrelte).

## `useGltfAnimations` Signature

The signature of the hook `useGltfAnimations` has changed. It no longer provides a callback that is invoked
when the `gltf` store has been populated and the `actions` store has been set. This is because it with the option to set
a custom root for the `THREE.AnimationAction`, the callback could be triggered multiple times, leading to an
unpredictable behavior. You should reside to using the `actions` store returned from the hook instead.

```ts
const { actions } = useGltfAnimations(gltf)
// this animation will play when the gltf store has been populated
// and the actions store has been set, effectively replacing the
// callback.
$: $actions.Greet?.play()
```

Check out the [hooks documentation](/docs/reference/extras/use-gltf-animations) for more information.

## `@threlte/rapier`

### Transform props

In an effort to clearly separate concerns, the components `<Collider>`, `<AutoColliders>` and `<RigidBody>` **no longer
offer transform props** (`position`, `rotation`, `scale` and `lookAt`). Instead, you should wrap these components
in for instance `<T.Group>` components and apply transforms on these.

```svelte title="Before.svelte" {2,3}-
<Collider
  position={[0, 1, 0]}
  rotation={[0, 45 * DEG2RAD, 0]}
>
  <T.Mesh>
    <T.BoxBufferGeometry />
    <T.MeshStandardMaterial />
  </T.Mesh>
</Collider>
```

```svelte title="After.svelte" {1-4,11}+
<T.Group
  position={[0, 1, 0]}
  rotation={[0, 45 * DEG2RAD, 0]}
>
  <Collider>
    <T.Mesh>
      <T.BoxBufferGeometry />
      <T.MeshStandardMaterial />
    </T.Mesh>
  </Collider>
</T.Group>
```
